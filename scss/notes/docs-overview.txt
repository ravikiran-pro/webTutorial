sass is a kind compiler for compiling the code into css
sass can be directly used or can be used with sscs
Something has much more flexibility towards css.
scss is compiled using saas to css
docs: https://sass-lang.com/documentation

ooh, even the docs gives preference to scss

Overall understanding
----------------------
1.) Follows more flexible,Allows to use dry priciple,Has things like varible,
,nesting,mixins,inheritance which helps us do that.
2.) that's enough reason to make people wow.Becaue strandizing gives much control
even though browser cant unsderstand sass or sccs.We can do it :-)
saas Follows unsimilar strcture to css where scss As more same synatical approach.

Getting into tutorial
-----------------------
    Note: following basic commands and syntax before the deep dive
    -----
Preprocessing sass
----------------------
    Sass can  be directly converted 
        sass --watch input.scss|input.sass output.css

varible declaration
--------------------

Similar to env build..
    Using by variable
    ---------------------
        sccs  --->similar to css
        -----
        $fontSize: 16px;  //Decalring variblas for dry usage(variable decalration,global)
        $primary-color: #333;
        element{
            font-size: $fontSize;  >>>can be directly defined (property defination)
        }
        _____________________________________________________
        sass    --->similar to python -_-
        -----
        fontSize: 16px;  
        primary-color: #333;
        element
            font-size: fontSize;  

        Don't joke u can write down the css conversion

    Nesting (my-kind)
    -----------------
        Nesting to the parent element nav ul
        scss
        -----
        $linkcolor: white
        nav{
            ul  /* (nav ul) *\
            {     
                list-style:none;
            }
            a   /* (nav a) *\
            {
                color:$linkcolor
            }
        }
        sass        >> Make it pythonish :-)
        css         >>expand it
    
    Partial
    -------
        changing to scss even makes it bigger?
        Here is partial kepp code aside and use it 

        partial file :  _filename.scss
        Using (another file): @import "filename";
        note : 
            1.) partial file starts with _partial.css (such they dont get compiled)
            2.) TO use partial use the keyword @import
    
    Mixins      (functions renamed -_-)
    -------
        Grouping an reusing css declaration
            @mixin transform($property) /*parameters*\{
                -webkit-transform: $property;   
                -ms-transform: $property;
                transform : $property;
            }
            /* call it *\
            .box {
                @include transform(rotate(30deg)); 
            }
                """"
                    A bit confusing check out doing examples
                        ---passing multiple parameters
                        ---whether can be implemented with Partial
                        ---Sass differs in syntax @cool let's learn that later
                """"

    Extend/Inheritance  ***hope important for dry codes
    ------------------
        This guys are seriouly geniu
        --->You can use the properties of other css selector by using inheritance
        ----> whereas extend which is based on a new concept called as placeholder

        How placeholder works ?
            When there is no input.It just shows the default text
        scss or saas going to get converted to css.I can't dump all elements especially those drawer type one
        placeholders help us to show such properties only when they are used
        Responsive layouts are good example
        ....Lets get into the code
        /* similar to base class *\
        %message-shared{
            border: 16px solid #ccc;
            padding: 10px;
            color:#333;
        }
        %equal-heights{
            display:flex;
            flex-wrap:wrap;
        }
        .message{
            @extend %message-shared; /*inheriting those properties*\
        }
        .success{
            @extend %message-shared; 
            border-color: green;
        }
        .error{
            @extend %message-shared;
        }
        .error:active{
            @extend %equal-heights;
        }
        css     (It is really beautiful)
        ----
           .error, .success, .message {
                border: 16px solid #ccc;  padding: 10px;  color: #333; }
            .error:active {
                display: flex;  flex-wrap: wrap; }
            /*inheriting those properties*/
            .success {
                border-color: green; }
